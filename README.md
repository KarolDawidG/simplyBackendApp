# simplyBackendApp

For now we have:
1. The login panel that reads data from the MySQL database.
2. A contact form that allows you to send an email from a website visitor.
3. After logging in, you can use a simple component to generate a new password.


The plans include:
1. Registration panel.
2. Unspecified features to improve backend skill.

This project has only one direct purpose, learning to code.
